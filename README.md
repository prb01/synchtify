## Final Deliverable (v1)

App where user creates account and links their Spotify account. Then, adds playlists they want to combine. App will use Spotify API to create a new playlist which is a combination of the 2 playlists. The synching of the playlists will be done manually in v1 with the idea that it becomes a daily/hourly task performed server-side in v2.
